## API Scalability

CaribPay API is built with scalability in mind to support increasing user demands and transaction volume across the Caribbean. Hereâ€™s how:

### Horizontal Scaling

- **Stateless API**: The Express server is stateless and can be easily scaled horizontally using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, or any container orchestration platform.
- **Load Balancing**: Can be integrated with AWS ELB or NGINX to distribute traffic across multiple instances.

### Database Scaling

- **Read/Write Separation (Planned)**: Future implementation of read replicas and write masters for PostgreSQL to handle read-heavy workloads.
- **Connection Pooling**: Prisma uses efficient connection pooling for concurrent database access.

### Caching (Planned)

- **Redis or Memcached**: Planned integration of Redis for caching frequently accessed data like exchange rates and wallet balances.

### Task Offloading

- **Background Jobs**: Long-running or delayed tasks (like notifications or scheduled maintenance) can be offloaded to job queues using BullMQ or RabbitMQ.
- **Webhook Support**: Funding confirmation and third-party integration via secure webhook endpoints.

### Rate Limiting

- **Per-IP Throttling**: Built-in rate limiting protects against abuse and DoS attacks.
- **Role-Based Throttling (Planned)**: Higher-tier users may get higher rate limits and transaction throughput.

### Monitoring & Alerts

- **Health Checks**: Integrated health endpoints for uptime monitoring.
- **Logging**: Structured logs for request tracing and audit logs for financial operations.
- **Integration**: CloudWatch for centralized logging and Prometheus/Grafana for performance metrics.
